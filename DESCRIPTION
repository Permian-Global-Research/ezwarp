Description: The goal of ezwarp is to simplify the use of gdalwarp in R. 
    gdalwarp is a very powerful and fast Image reprojection and warping utility. 
    It can be used to reproject (i.e. transform to a new Coordinate Reference 
    System), crop, mask and resample. Unlike many tools in R, this can all be done 
    in a single command, using the warp tool, saving time and code.
