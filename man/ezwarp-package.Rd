\title{ezwarp: A utility tool for working with gdal warp in R}
\description{
The goal of ezwarp is to simplify the use of gdalwarp in R. gdalwarp is a very powerful and fast Image reprojection and warping utility. It can be used to reproject (i.e. transform to a new Coordinate Reference System), crop, mask and resample. Unlike many tools in R, this can all be done in a single command, using the warp tool, saving time and code.
